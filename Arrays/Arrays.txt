Arrays : It is Linear Data Structure.
         It stores same data type elements 
         It have fixed size 
         The memory locations store data in continues manner 
         It can effectively in Accesing by index O(1)

Resizing (Dynamic Arrays)	O(N)	Reallocating and copying elements when the array grows.
Slicing	O(k)	Extracting a portion of the array (sub-array).
