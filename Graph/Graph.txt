Degree of a Vertex	The number of edges connected to a vertex.
Check if Graph is Empty	Checks if the graph contains any vertices or edges.
Get Number of Vertices	Returns the number of vertices in the graph.
Get Number of Edges	Returns the total number of edges in the graph.
Check if Directed or Undirected
